## Project Overview üöÄ

[DEMO LINK](https://Opokhvalenko.github.io/task-trek-angular/)

TaskTrek is a modern, full-featured web application for task management (Todo List), meticulously crafted with Angular. This project exemplifies the application of cutting-edge Angular concepts, including Standalone Components, Reactive Forms, Router-driven filtering, and robust data handling via HttpClient and RxJS for asynchronous operations. It provides an intuitive and seamless interface for efficiently organizing and managing daily and long-term tasks.

This application serves as a prime example of my front-end development capabilities, highlighting:

- **Clean and Modular Architecture:** Crafting well-structured and reusable components for maintainability and scalability.

- **Reactive State Management:** Efficiently handling application state using RxJS `BehaviorSubject` for a highly responsive user experience.

* **Seamless API Integration:** Demonstrating robust data persistence and synchronization with a remote backend API.

- **Automated Code Quality:** Configuring and maintaining essential development tools like ESLint (for static analysis) and Prettier (for consistent code formatting).

## Key Features üìù

- **Task Creation**: Effortlessly add new tasks to your personalized list.

- **Task Editing:** Easily modify the titles of existing tasks with a double-click.

- **Status Toggling:** Mark tasks as "completed" ‚úÖ or "active" ‚è≥ with a simple click.

- **Task Deletion:** Remove individual tasks üóëÔ∏è or clear all completed tasks with a dedicated button.

- **Dynamic Filtering:** View tasks by various statuses: "All," "Active," or "Completed," leveraging Angular's powerful routing capabilities.

- **Data Persistence:** All task data is securely stored on an external API, ensuring your tasks are resilient across browser sessions.

- **Modern Angular Stack:** Built with the latest Angular features, including Standalone Components, for enhanced modularity and optimal performance.

- **High Code Standards:** Code quality and consistency are enforced through pre-configured ESLint rules, Stylelint and automatic formatting with Prettier.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend Framework:** Angular (Standalone Components)

- **Programming Language:** TypeScript

- **State Management:** RxJS (`BehaviorSubject, map, filter, switchMap, withLatestFrom, tap`)

- **HTTP Requests:** `HttpClient`

- **Routing:** Angular Router

- **Forms:** Angular Reactive Forms and Template-driven Forms

- **API Integration:** External RESTful API for data operations.

- **Styling:** SCSS / CSS

- **Development Tools:** ESLint (for code linting), Prettier (for consistent code formatting)

## Additional Information (For Developers) üí°

- **Code Scaffolding:** Angular CLI provides powerful tools to generate components, directives, services, and more.
  For example, to generate a new component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics, run: `ng generate --help`.

- **Project Building:** To compile the project, run `ng build`. Build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
